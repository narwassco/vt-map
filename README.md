This is a simple tool to create vector tile map on Github pages.

## This repository is no londer used. It has been moved to [narwassco/vt](https://github.com/narwassco/vt)!

## Installation
### tippecanoe
This module uses [`tippecanoe`](https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe) to convert geojson files to mbtiles. Please make sure to install it before running.

for MacOS
```
$ brew install tippecanoe
```

for Ubuntu
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe.git
$ cd tippecanoe

```

### main module
```
git clone https://github.com/narwassco/vt-map.git
npm install
```

## Configuration
All the settings are in `config.js`, so please make sure your own settings on this file before producing vector tile.

Please create `app-docker.env` file under project root directory to put environment variable for database settings.
```
export_dir=/tmp/src/vt-map

db_user=postgres
db_password=Your password
db_host=host.docker.internal
db_post=5432
db_name=narwassco
```

The stylefile `style.json` under this repository is just for checking the vector tile data.

We are managing Mapbox Stylefile in [narwassco/mapbox-stylefiles](https://github.com/narwassco/mapbox-stylefiles).

## Create vector tile from your PostGIS database by using Docker

Build Docker Image
```
docker build -t narwassco/vt-map .

Create Vector Tile and sprite files under public directory.
```
